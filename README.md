## Requirements

Sage 9.0 or later is recommended.

## Installation

### Install from GitHub (recommended)

To download and install the latest development version on a system where Sage
was built from source or installed from official packages, run

    sage -pip install git+https://github.com/MarcusAichmayr/elementary_vectors.git

or

    sage -pip install --user git+https://github.com/MarcusAichmayr/elementary_vectors.git

The optional `--user` flag causes the package to be installed in your `.sage` directory instead of the Sage installation tree.

### Local install from source

Download the source from the git repository:

    git clone https://github.com/MarcusAichmayr/elementary_vectors.git

Change to the root directory of the repository and run:

    sage -pip install --upgrade --no-index -v .

You can also run instead the shorthand:

    make install

### Local install from source (no Sage installation required)

    git clone https://github.com/MarcusAichmayr/elementary_vectors.git

Change to the root directory of the repository and run:

    python3 -m venv venv
    . venv/bin/activate
    pip install -v -e ".[passagemath]"
